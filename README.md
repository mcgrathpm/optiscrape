Scrape Optimizely JSON object from deployed site.
--------

Optimizely is a next generation client-side AB testing platform, utilized by large web presences like Starbucks.com, Rocketlawyer.com, and 37 signals.

Optimizely works by generating a minified JSON object that contains experiment IDs associated with all code changes made in that variation. This object can be pulled, parsed, and re-deployed with an eval to render the exact changes being tested.

This is research tool for recommendations on what sort of elements to AB test on a page - from colors on signup forms to prices suggested for 'refill' on a Starbucks gift card.
